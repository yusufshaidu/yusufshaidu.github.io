I earned my Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics from SISSA,Trieste, Italy, where my research centered on the development and application of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs). My work emphasizes efficient data generation workflows, physics-informed model design, and large-scale, long-timescale MLIP-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. By bridging the quantum mechanical accuracy of DFT with the computational efficiency of machine learning, I develop accurate and transferable MLIPs that enable predictive modeling and materials discovery for complex material systems.  
I develop scientific software, including open-source frameworks for atomistic simulations and machine learning potentials.
